                    <div class="letter-paragraph">
                        I must say, looking back three or four years, I never expected to be wishing you this way, yet here we are. It goes without saying, but this past year has been one of the best for me — not because I achieved something extraordinary in particular, but because I knew in the back of my mind that even my smallest successes and failures I could share with you. From the texting really late at night, the occasional facetiming each other (in the presence of Muhammad, heh…), and even the sharing of tiktoks and reels — I’ve absolutely loved it all and I wouldn’t trade our BESTfriendship for anything.
                    </div>

                    <div class="letter-paragraph">
                        Remember the time I got a bad grade in Chemistry and I was so insanely depressed? Who helped me get through that? It was you. It has always been you. Every time, without failure. Through every moment of grief and all sparks of joy, you’ve been right there with me — acting as the shoulder that I need to lean on sometimes. Leena, I will always be grateful to you for what all you’ve done for me. I will always be grateful for the hours and hours you have spent talking with me about everything and nothing at the same time, sharing your tea and parts of your day when you never really had to.
                    </div>

                    <div class="letter-paragraph">
                        I’ve had friends, even best friends before you. But you? You’re so much different. You’re the one I truly grew up with. You’ve been through it all with me. You’ve experienced my cringe phase (doesn’t seem to have ended), my wannabe UwU phase, my emo phase, my naive phase, my current anime phase… and through all of this, you never once made me feel like I had to put up a mask and be someone who I’m not with you. I opened up to you in ways I could have never even imagined I could. I don’t think this sort of trust is something that you experience twice in one lifetime. I know that regardless of what you tell me, deep down, you will be the most special person I have ever met and ever will meet because you were the only one I had who stuck with me through my depressing teenage years and gave me reasons to laugh, not knowing how much you’re helping me and how much of a positive impact you’re making on me, and that’s what makes you irreplaceable. Our BESTfriendship to me has been one of the best, if not the best decision I’ve ever made.

                    <div class="letter-paragraph">
                        Today, as we celebrate your 19th birthday, I hope you truly feel how important, dearly loved, and appreciated you are. As I’m growing up, I’m realizing that I never longed for a lot of friends — I just needed one that truly cared about me, and that has always been you. Thank you for listening to me without judgement (well, for the most part heheha), and for showing me what it means to have a real BESTfriend.

                        In honor of your 19th birthday, I decided to comprise a list of 19 things that I love about you. Honestly, I had a hard time narrowing the list down as there are so many wondrous things about you that I could mention. The ones that I did end up mentioning are the ones that just thinking of them, brought a smile to my face.
                    </div>
                    <ol class="points-list">
                        <li>How helpful you are. You would make birthday posts for me to use for my friends. You also made a presentation in canva for me once</li>
                        <li>Your fashion sense. I love it sm the way you dress is so ugh oh my god I fanboy sm</li>
                        <li>The sound of your laugh.</li>
                        <li>The way you GASLIGHT everyone then win in Mafia.</li>
                        <li>How you are so appreciative. Whenever I do something out of the ordinary, you get so happy which makes me happy but you need to raise ur standards u deserve the world don’t settle for any less!!</li>
                        <li>Your goofy expressions HHEHAHA I LOVE THEM SM HOW do u have an expression for everything??</li>
                        <li>How your cheeks and nose get a natural blush after you cry and you end up looking like a diva. lowkey jealous >:(</li>
                        <li>How you decided to keep texting me even though I was such a weird bacha</li>
                        <li>How u always give me advice on how to look better and i just trust u bc ik ur right.</li>
                        <li>How you played Minecraft with me so nicely!!</li>
                        <li>How being around you my mood just lifts. I could be feeling down, depressed, and sad but one conversation with you will leave me feeling so happy idk how u do it…</li>
                        <li>The way you sing songs it’s a special kinda way.</li>
                        <li>Being the only person I would feel safe crying infront of. This past year has made me trust you more than ever before.</li>
                        <li>How you text me for an hour atleast almost everyday after I wake up. Truly makes my day.</li>
                        <li>How you’re the first person I’d ask for advice on genuinely ANYTHING. I trust your judgement more than anyone else.</li>
                        <li>How you’re the first to notice when I’m feeling off. Whenever I feel sad it’s like you just know… are you watching me?</li>
                        <li>How you made tiktoks with me in Pakistan without me even having to ask!! Insha’Allah next time we meet we make even more heheh.</li>
                        <li>How you try to listen to me and understand me even when it seems impossible. I love feeling heard, especially at times when I’m unable to express what I’m thinking or saying. You’re the only person who does this, and I really love that :)</li>
                        <li>How you chose ME to be your bestfriend. Honestly? I don’t think I’m deserving. You could do SO MUCH better than ME like I’m always pissing u off and making you mad or sad or even cry… but you have never stopped calling me your bestfriend, and that’s what I love the most about you.</li>
